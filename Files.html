<h1>Adaptive</h1>
<p class="a"> I mastered the skill of adapting to my sorroundings,
     I am able to adjust at any situation given to me. <br>
     I have the capacity to provide a soution despite being a complete 
     beginner to a certain field.<br> Adaptability will be a great asset that
    I am proud to possess</p>
    <br>
<h1>Ability to work under Pressure</h1>
<p class="b"> The ability of working under pressure is a skill not everyone 
possess. <br>It requires the ultimate control of our minds and the capacity of it
even in times of stress.<br> I am able to complete a task despite multiple hindrances
that may slow me down.<br> To me, having this skill is a very useful one due to our 
everychanging and fast-paced world.
</p>
<br>
<h1>Social</h1>
<p class="c"> Being a social person have their own pro's and con's. <br>But for me,
    socializing provides connections to useful people that may be a part of my identity. 
    <br>They might be the way for me to learn more about things I need to succeed. <br>Being a sociable 
    person also gives me time to observe how people behave, and who to avoid.
